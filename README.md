# FeedParser
The FeedParser is a framework for parsing of RSS and Atom feeds.

## Running tests
To run the unit tests correctly, the files "atom.xml", "sample-feed.xml.rss" and "sample.xml.rss" must be copied to a web server. The url in the test case must be also changed, to point to the test files.
